# Content-Recommendation-System

This project implements a content-based recommendation system that suggests similar products based on their descriptions, tags, and metadata. The model uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to compute product similarity and generate recommendations.

üìå Overview :

Dataset: Walmart product reviews dataset (TSV format, ~5k records).
Goal: Recommend products to users based on product descriptions, tags, brand, and categories.
Approach:
Preprocess dataset (handle missing values, select relevant columns).
Convert text features into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
Compute cosine similarity between product vectors.
Recommend top N similar products for a given product.

üöÄ Features :

Content-based filtering
Uses TF-IDF on product descriptions and tags
Cosine similarity for recommendation ranking
Scalable to larger datasets
Modular notebook for experimentation

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack :

Language: Python 3.x
Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy (data processing)
Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
SciPy (sparse matrix operations)

üìù Conclusion :

This project demonstrates how a content-based recommendation system can be built using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. By analyzing product descriptions, tags, and categories, the system effectively suggests similar products to users. While the current implementation works well for static datasets, it can be enhanced further with hybrid methods, real-time personalization, and deployment as a web application.
The project highlights the potential of machine learning in improving customer experience through personalized recommendations, which are widely used in e-commerce platforms, streaming services, and digital marketplaces.

üìà Future Improvements :

Hybrid recommendation system (combine user-based + content-based)
Deploy as a web app with Flask/Streamlit
Add evaluation metrics (precision@k, recall@k, NDCG)
Support for real-time recommendations
